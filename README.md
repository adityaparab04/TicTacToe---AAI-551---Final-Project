# TicTacToe---AAI-551---Final-Project
3x3 Tic Tac Toe game using python
Goal: Directly apply the Python programming concepts we examined in our lectures to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Assignment
	•	Create a 3x3 board using a 2-dimensional array and initialize each element as empty.
	•	You can represent empty using any symbol you like.
	•	Write a Function to check whether the board is filled or not.
	•	Iterate over the board and return false if the board contains an empty sign or else return true.
	•	Write a Function to check whether a player has won or not.
	•	You have to check the possibilities mentioned item 2.
	•	Check for all the rows, columns, and two diagonals.
	•	Write Function to show the board. (You will show the board multiple times to the users while they are playing).
	•	Write a Function to start the game.
	•	Select the first turn of the player randomly.
	•	Write an infinite loop that breaks when the game is over (either win or draw).
	•	Show the board to the user to select the spot for the next move.
	•	Ask the user to enter the row and column number.
	•	Update the spot with the respective player sign.
	•	Check whether the current player won the game or not.
	•	If the current player won the game, then print a winning message and break the infinite loop.
	•	Next, check whether the board is filled or not.
	•	If the board is filled, then print the draw message and break the infinite loop.
	•	Finally, show the user the final view of the board.
Required conditions:
	•	Win: If a player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win the game.
	•	Draw: If all the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
	•	Illegal move: If a player tries to make a move on a space that is already occupied, it is considered an illegal move. The player should make a move on an empty space.
